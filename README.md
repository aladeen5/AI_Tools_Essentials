In this project, we have three models, 

 MNIST & Amazon Reviews AI Project

 Overview
This project demonstrates two AI applications using TensorFlow and spaCy:

1. MNIST CNN Classifier – A Convolutional Neural Network that classifies handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset with >95% accuracy.  
2. Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis – A Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that analyzes product reviews using spaCy and TextBlob for linguistic and sentiment insights.
3. Handwritten digits classification using sci-kit learn


 Features
- TensorFlow CNN model for image classification  
- Streamlit web app for digit prediction (upload or draw digits interactively)  
- spaCy pipeline for text preprocessing  
- TextBlob for sentiment polarity scoring  
- Ethical bias discussion and fairness mitigation strategies
